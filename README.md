# FullStack Ecommerce  Client Panel

The NextEcommerce Client Panel is a fullstack e-commerce application designed to provide a seamless experience for both customers and administrators. This platform allows users to browse products, manage orders, and interact with a modern and user-friendly interface built with React, Next.js, TypeScript and Node.js.

## üéØ Purpose

The NextEcommerce Client Panel is a fullstack e-commerce application built with the goal of learning and sharing knowledge about how to develop modern web applications. This project serves both as a personal learning journey and a resource for others who want to understand how to build fullstack applications, particularly in the context of e-commerce platforms.

Through this project, I aim to showcase the process of creating a full-featured e-commerce system, with an emphasis on best practices, modular code, and clean architecture. I‚Äôll be uploading regular progress updates on my YouTube channel to share the learning process, challenges, and solutions that come with building such an application.

All uploads and updates to this project will be done on a weekly basis, ensuring continuous learning and improvements. This will also allow anyone following the series to learn alongside me and implement what they learn in their own projects.
